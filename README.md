 👋 Hi, I’m GerardC.
 👀 I’m interested in fighting 'old age'!
 
 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Vim, C, and C++ 
 to keep my mind challenged.
 
💞️ It would be nice to meet people in my own age 
group; seventies!  :(

📫 How to reach me:  Here, I guess??

😄 Pronouns: Singular me, you, she, he, it.  
Plural pronouns: we, ye/you, they.  :)

⚡ NOT a Fun fact:  I'm retired!

I am looking forward to learning more about GitHub, 
what it is, 

it's community, and what it has to offer.
